### Removed :warning: Breaking Changes :warning:

The `--copy` flag of `dra-untag` added in the previous release has been removed for some issues on different linux desktop environments.
There was no good solution that worked reliably everywhere, so it was decided to completely remove it since it's not worth the hassle for a "nice to
have" feature like this ([055a4bc](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra/commit/055a4bcbbbf62d8953aa77679f842dcc0bbb4f55)).

### Added

  Windows) ([#90](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra/issues/90))

The `install` feature for tar and zip archives no longer rely on `tar` and `unzip` command lines.

More info on commit [5f73077](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra/commit/5f7307753ea87701a2b8180698a68d86278ee0f8)

### Development

In order to speed up integration tests on CI it was created a custom docker image with all
runtime dependencies already installed ([devmatteini/dra-ubuntu-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/devmatteini/dra-ubuntu-base)).

### Updated dependencies

- `clap` from 3.1.12 to 3.1.14
- `clap_complete` from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3
- `serde` from 1.0.136 to 1.0.137

## [0.3.3] - 2022-04-25

### Changed

- The [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) is now using [github cli](https://cli.github.com/) to create github release and upload
  assets, since `actions/create-release` and `actions/upload-release-asset` are not maintained anymore.

### Development

- [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) is now used to weekly update cargo crates and github actions
- Integration tests are now faster to run on both host machine and CI (see 1f36ffc12e4bb2da07be3106bc982d76419c7bf0 for more details)

### Updated dependencies

- `test-case` from 1.2.1 to 1.2.3

## [0.3.2] - 2022-03-31

### :warning: Breaking Changes :warning:

The command line interface has changed to `dra <SUBCOMMAND>`.

The `<REPO>` positional argument must be passed after choosing `download` or `untag` subcommand (e.g `dra download <REPO>`)

This change was needed in order to add subcommands/flags that didn't require `<REPO>`, like the newly added `completion`.

### Added

- Generate shell completion with `dra completion <SHELL>`

### Updated dependencies

- clap 3.0.13 -> 3.1.6

## [0.3.1] - 2022-03-19

### Changed

- Improve `dra-download` and `dra-untag` UX by showing a spinner while fetching the release information
- `dra-download` and `dra-untag` now print which release tag is currently used

### Fixed

- GitHub releases with no assets are now handled properly
- If CTRL+C was pressed during the asset selection the cursor would not be restored (in both `dra-download` and `dra-untag` sub commands).

  The issue and solution that we implemented is described here [mitsuhiko/dialoguer/issues/77](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/dialoguer/issues/77).

## [0.3.0] - 2022-03-15

### Added

- Download and install some supported assets (`dra <repo> download --[i]nstall`).

  The supported assets are:

  - Debian packages (`.deb`)
  - Tar archive with executable inside (`.tar.[gz|bz2|xz]`)
  - Zip file with executable inside (`.zip`)

### Internals

Integration tests have been added to test the installation methods for the various supported assets.
For more information on how this tests works, read the [docs](./tests/README.md).

## [0.2.3] - 2022-02-05

## [0.2.1] - 2022-01-06

### Added

- Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines

  @orhun ([See pull request](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra/pull/2))

## [0.2.0] - 2021-12-27

Change application name from `dag` to `dra`.

`dag` is widely used as the acronym of [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

To avoid any confusion I decided to rename this application to `dra`.
The new name is the acronym of `Download Release Asset`.

The repository url has changed as well: https://github.com/devmatteini/dra

## [0.1.0] - 2021-12-21

Initial release of `dag`.

### Added

- Select and download an asset from a repository (interactive)
- Save a downloaded asset to custom file path (`dag <repo> download --output <path>`)
- Generate a pattern to auto select an asset to download (`dag <repo> untag`)
- Auto select and download an asset (`dag <repo> download --select <pattern>`).

  The `--select` value is the pattern generated by `dag-untag` command
