## Why should I use dra?

You can do everything `dra` does with the official [GitHub cli](https://cli.github.com/).

`dra` helps you download release assets more easily:

- no authentication for public repository (you cannot use `gh` without authentication)
- [Built-in generation of pattern](#non-interactive) to select an asset to download
  (with `gh` you need to provide [glob pattern](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_download) that you need to
  create manually).

## Installation

`dra` is available on Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended

Download the prebuilt versions of `dra` for supported platforms from the [latest release](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra/releases/latest).

### Debian-based distributions

Download the latest `.deb` package from the [release page](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra/releases/latest) and
install it via:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i dra_x.y.z_amd64.deb # adapt version number
```

### On Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install `dra` from the [community repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/dra/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```bash
pacman -S dra
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devmatteini/dra && cd dra
make release
./target/release/dra --version
```

## Usage

In order to download assets from private repositories (and avoid rate limit issues) export an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>`.

Follow the official guide to create
a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
The minimum set of scopes needed is: `Full control of private repositories `.

### Interactive

Select and download an asset from a repository

```
$ dra download devmatteini/dra-tests
```

Select and download an asset to custom path

```
$ dra download --output /tmp/dra-example devmatteini/dra-tests
```

Select and download an asset from a specific release

```
$ dra download --tag 0.1.1 devmatteini/dra-tests
```

Select and download source code archives

```
$ dra download devmatteini/dra-tests
Release tag is 0.1.5
? Pick the asset to download ›
  helloworld_0.1.5.tar.gz
❯ Source code (tar.gz)
  Source code (zip)
```

### Install assets

Download and install an asset (on both interactive and non-interactive modes)

```
$ dra download --install devmatteini/dra-tests
```

Supported assets that can be installed are:

- Debian packages (`.deb`)
- Tar archive with executable (`.tar.[gz|bz2|xz]`)
- Zip file with executable (`.zip`)

### Non-Interactive

This mode is useful to be used in automated scripts.

First you need to generate an untagged asset name:

```
$ dra untag devmatteini/dra-tests
helloworld_{tag}.tar.gz
```

Copy the output and run:

```
$ dra download --select "helloworld_{tag}.tar.gz" devmatteini/dra-tests
```

This last command can be used in automated scripts without human interaction.

### Shell completion

Generate shell completion

```
$ dra completion bash > dra-completion
$ source dra-completion
```

See all supported shell with `dra completion -h`
